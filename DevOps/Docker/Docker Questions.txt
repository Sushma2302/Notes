Docker: 

Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship
and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop
applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

Features of Docker
 Docker has the ability to reduce the size of development by providing a smaller
footprint of the operating system via containers.
 With containers, it becomes easier for teams across different units, such as
development, QA and Operations to work seamlessly across applications.
 You can deploy Docker containers anywhere, on any physical and virtual machines
and even on the cloud.
 Since Docker containers are pretty lightweight, they are very easily scalable.

Q4) What is Docker image?

Docker image can be understood as a template from which Docker containers can be created as many as we want out of that single Docker image. 

Q5) What is Docker container?
Docker containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers, 
running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, 
on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.	

Q6) What is Docker hub?

Docker hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to 
Docker cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts.
