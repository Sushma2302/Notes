Docker is a container 

Advantages:

We can run any number of containers in one OS.
Each container is a process in the main OS where as in VM ware every VM itself a OS.
In this way we can save memoey and processing power.
Container can bring up in seconds where as VM take minutes to start
Effective space and memory and process management.

Docker internally uses name spaces(name spaces concept is there in the linex from the begining)

Docker is for both stateless and stateful. it uses micro services 

Disadvantages:

Less control compared to VM. For example in VM we can give different access controls for four VM mechines where as we can give only one 
leven of access to the four containers running in the same mechine.

Stateful vs statteless
Stateful means which stores the date where as stateless means will not store any date but only respond to the incomming requestswith the static data

Container registery(Docker HUB) is like a play store for dicker

Job of the services is to recive the request from different application and give them to the other services, this is called rest services

Service doesnot require any storage space 

To login we need a rest services, everything will be a thin services and this small services are called micro services


Docker containers are for the web applications but not for the windows application. Ex: we can not have a container for the excel or word (Any application which requires
installation on mechine), but we can have a docker container for any web application

Containers are two types
1. Private (Accable to perticular users who have access)
2. Public (Any one can use them)


#docker run centos -- 
the above statment will first check for the image locally , if not available it will search for the image in docker hub. 

#docker images 
List out the images available locally

#docker ps -- Will list the containers running in the mechine
#docker ps -a -- will list the all the containers (Including inactive containers)

Docker can be executed in 2 modes 
1. Foreground mode _ It will be keep us on the container terminal but not in mechine Ex: docker run hello-world
2. Detached mode _ in this mode we will get the terminal back once it is started  Ex: docker run -d hello-world

Run command will be used for only once. It will create a new container everytime we run the "run" command 
Means, If i user the command "docker run centos" - it will download the centos container and it will run the container and stop it.
If i want to run the same container again we need to use start and stop comands but not the run command. if we run the "run" command again it will 
create a new container

To start the container # docker start containerID

Dokcer will be installed in the following path /var/lib/docker/

We can give names to the docker images by passing parameter -name Name_of_container 
If we dont pass a name docker will give a name randomly

We can remove the container using rm command

docker rm dockername/dockerid

we cannot delete the docker images until we delete all the container which were created by that image.

to remove image 
#docker rmi imageID

We can create the images from other images as well. 



https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#understand-build-context

When we write a docker file FROM must be the first statment.


FROM ImageName<:tag(Nothing but version)>
Ex: FROM Jenkins:7.651
Best practice is to metion the tag value.


##Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service.##

Any docker file will contain the following fields

FROM imageName<:tag>
MAINTAINER srinivas0717@gmail.com(Email ID)
RUN  # It will executes when ever you creating a container out of this image
CMD  # this will execute when ever your container started 

Once we write the file we need to create a image from this file to do that 
# docker build -t name_of_image:latest .(Path of the Dockerfile)

While downloading the images it will download few more things which we can see on the comamnd line screen, those are called image alyers
