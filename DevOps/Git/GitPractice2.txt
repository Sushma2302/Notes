Scenario: Conflict if a perticular file -- how to solve the confilcts 

Step 1: cloned the repositiory in hte node2,
2,. cloned the repositiory in the node1
3. added a line in the file form node2 and commited it followed by push statment
4. now added a line in the same file form node1 and commted the file - here i got the below error

#To https://github.com/Srinivas0717/Gitpractice
# ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
#error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Srinivas0717/Gitpractice'
#hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
#hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
#hint: to the same ref. You may want to first merge the remote changes (e.g.,
#hint: 'git pull') before pushing again.
#hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.



Now tried to pull the central repo 
#git pull -- them i have run into the nelow

Auto-merging gittwo.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in gittwo.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


After the aobe result, if we open the gittwo.txt  it will be like 

this file is added in gittwo node
<<<<<<< HEAD

agin this is added after adding second by gitoneuser  -- this line is adde in the current noed (node2)
=======
this line is added in gitone after pull it from origin -- this line was added by the other user, and it exists in the current centralized repo in github
>>>>>>> 8c0c22e8986e13756fce71dc123bddaec44c86d6


based on the requirement edit the file and do the add it again



---- Branches

git branch "New branch name"
git checkout "New branch name"
git branck -D "branch to delete"
git branch -- to list out the available branches

git push origin "New branch name" -- to push the changes from new branch to the mail server





I have two branches with the following files in there:

branch a:

file_a
file_b
file_c
branch b:

file_a
file_d
file_e
I want to merge them, so that I get both files from a and b (and files that exist in both should normally be merged)! is that possbile?


in your case you would do the following:

git checkout a (you will switch to branch a)
git merge b (this will merge all changes from branch b into branch a)
git commit -a (this will commit your changes)
