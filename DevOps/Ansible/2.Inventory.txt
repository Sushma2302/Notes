 install wisSCP s/w to connect to the server and edit the files form windows interfaces.
 
create a file named as inventary

and provide the list in that file. 

Rules
One host per one line.
startign with # will be ignored 
any spaces in line will also be ignored

By defualt we have two groups in inventary
1. all
2. nogroup

to list the servers in the inventary use ansible command.

#ansible -i inventory all --list-hosts

For example we have 50 servers and 10 of the are production servers. 
I want to change some configuaration in the prod servers only, 
to achieve this, inventary file allows us to group the servers...... (Can find this in ansible docs also)

Refer the "NamingConventionInRelatime.xlx" file for different grops. 

We can pass the parameters to the hosts file. In the excel IP is the Host variable and datacenter, purpose are the group variables
