By defualt ansible configuaration file will be placed in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
You can define the defualt parameters here.

Simply copy this file into your directiry(Current dir)

In this file we can define the inventory file

inventory = path
remote_user = user_name (can provide the defualt user here)

setting ansible config file 

we can do it in three ways
1)
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/temp/ansible.cfg (through shall variable), inthe first place it will check for the shall variable and will pick from that variable if it is 
defined.
unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG (to unset the variable)
2)
Present working directory (it will pick this file)
3)
place the config file in the home directory of the user (it will take automatically)
This file should be a hidden file (.ansible.conf)
4)
And at last it will search in /etc/ansible/ansible.conf

It will pick which ever it find first.
