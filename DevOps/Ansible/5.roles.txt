Here we should create a role with the required tasks and then will call that role in our playbooks. 

Note: If you get any error while installing or running a script saying that "some.extention"  is missing, 
	We can ask YUM which software will provide this file by using the below command
	#yum provides "FileName"
	#yum provides "*/FileName"
This will display the list of softwares which provide the mentioned file.
