Jenkins:

It is a open source, we dont get any support from the developer, but we have blogs where developers will answer your questions

Cloud base:

Cloud base took the jenkins and do some customizations and will provide the official support for that product.
It is a paid version

Spint - the cycle when the new release happes 
For example jenkins spint is 3 months (For every three months there will be a majour release)

Cloud base is a enterprise product (which is a paid version and will get the support)

1)free style
   we can integrate any fype of files.
2)maven job
   we can integrate only java files
3)pipeline jobs
  sequence of jobs, one job is connected to anothr job.
4)multipipe line jobs

Q)how to schedule a job in jenkins?
 - get the code from scm server (gitbucket)
 - setting trigger (build process trigger)
 - setup build environment 
 - build acion
 - post build action
 
 
build pipeline -- this plug in will give us a graphical representation of the pipeline jobs

Usual flow in organizations:

Initially create a master branch
After thhat a development branch will be created as a fork of master 
All the development and build test using maven will be done in the other branch

To push the changes to master in the "Post-build Actions" section we should provide "orign" for the filed "Target remote name"

once we create a war file, we can deploy it into tomcat server using the "deploy to container" plug in

backup -- plug in will hekp us to create backups and restoes of current jobs and work spalces etc ..
rolebased authorization strategy -- will allow us to create roles 
and then we need to enable the roles in the configure global section
