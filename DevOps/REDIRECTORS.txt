REDIRECTORS:
Usually we will give input by keyboard& output by TerminalIf you want to give input by file we will use redirectors, if you want to give input by file we must create file

STDIN-standard input means if you would like to take input from a file, instead of the command line
	
STDOUT-if you would like to redirect the output we will use STDOUT

Assume if you want to get output& error in different file then?

$ls srinivas ponnaganti 1>out 2>error
 In the above example srinivas is a folder and exists in the current directory and ponnaganti is not there in the current directory, in that case output will be stored in out
 file and the error will be stored in the error file
