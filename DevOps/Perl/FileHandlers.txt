#File handlers

File handlers will access the file. 

We can open a file in two ways

1. open FileHandler , Filename with mode
2. sysopen FileHandler, FileName, Mode

Different filemodes:

Reading --> open(FileHandler, "<FileName")
Writting --> open(FileHandler, ">FileName")
Appending --> open(FileHandler, ">>FileName")
Reading and Writting --> open(FileHandler, "+<FileName")
Reading, Writting and creating --> open(FileHandler, "+>FileName")
Reading, Writting, Appending and creating --> open(FileHandler, "+>>FileName")
Closing--> close(<FileHandler>)

Reading file in an array:

@filelines = <FileHandler>

Writting into file -->  print <FileHandler> "<Content>"
Rename a file --> rename ("<Old FileName>","<new FileName>")
Delet a file --> delete("FileName")
Current position of a file --> tell <FileHandler>
To point to a position of a file --> seek <FileHandler><Position><Whence>
