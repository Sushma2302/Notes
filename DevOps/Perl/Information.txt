We have two pragmas in perl
1. strict
2. warnings


1. strict:

It will force script to declare the scope of the variables.
Identifies the bugs.


2. warnings

Missing semicaolans
Wrong syntax
Depricated functions
Declaring a variabels with same name again


Conditional operators:

if
if..else
if..elsif..else
unless
unless..else
unless..elsif..else
switch

Ternory operator:
(condition)?<true>:<false>


Loops:

while
do..while
until 
for
fireach
while..each
nested loops


Loop control statments:

next :  Skips the remaining code based on condition and re-iterates through the loop

last: terminates the loop

continue: Block in continue is executed just before the next iteration

redo: restarts the loop with out evelauting the condition

goto: jumps the statment with given lable, expression or subroutine

infinite loop or recursive loop: executes where condition never becomes false

for(;;) is used for run with out a condition recrsively, to stop this we can use ctrl+c to come out of the execution
