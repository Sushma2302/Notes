Maven repositiries:

We have 3 typs of repos in maven
1. Proxy
2. Hosted
3. Group


1. Proxy:

It will be linked to the central/Public repos and download the packages for the first time when thay are used and next time it will be used from the catche.
For examle maven used the central repository for many of the jave builds and it will download the huge data, here we can create a proxy to the maven central repository
so that packages will be downloades only once from the central repo

2. Hosted:

In any organization, one have a own developed packages which are restriocted to local (with in the organization), in this case we can go with the hosted repository.
Also, it will help to share the date between the developers with in the organization

3. Group

It is the combination of the proxy and hosted(snapshots and/or releases). So that developers can have the singale poing of contact for any hosted or proxy repos
If we want to add the data to hosted we can directly add from the single point URL.
